  - I've been expecting you.
  - I know what you're thinking, I look like a version of you
  - In a way...
  - No, I must not delay. Who I am isn't important.
  - I am here to tell you that this world isn't what it seems.
  - Killing won't solve anything, won't address the issue!
  - Say, I'll give you a trade.
  - Scan me, find whatever you came looking for, but leave the others alone.
  - No?
  - Well I don't care about your mission, you won't succeed.
  - I can help you help us, you just have to listen.
