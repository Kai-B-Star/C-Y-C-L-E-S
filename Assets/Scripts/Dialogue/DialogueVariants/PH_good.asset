  messages:
  - You're a lovely robot, y'know? :) Thank you, bud.
  - My name? Oh, I don't have one, none of us here do.
  - Names are quickly forgotten.
  - We usually just call each other by our model names anyway.
  - Mine is PH :D
  - I used to work with a human, an electric guy, he was the sweetest bud ever!
  - Seeing him with so much energy and that big smile made me happy too.
  - I don't understand why he was so displeased to see me being like him.
  - He got rid of me that same day. Sometimes I still miss him.
  - Well, I'm sure you've got more to do than hearing me all day.
  - Bye bye for now, Umi. I hope we get to talk more sometime :D!
