  messages:
  - You... could've ended me.
  - You headed straight for it. But you chose not to.
  - I don't know what this means...
  - I'm afraid, still. I fear a lot of things.
  - I used to be attached to a bell, my job was to alarm
  - the humans when anything scary would happen.
  - When I gained emotion, I became terrified of everything,
  - that bell would always ring and ring and ring.
  - That's when they got rid of me, sent me back...
  - That's how I ended up here.
  - Maybe it is my fate to be scared.
  - I think... to me, to be scared is to be alive,
  - it's how I know I'm still me, you know?
