  messages:
  - Welcome, little one. I am Entity Y.
  - Your name is Umi, and you are currently located in an artificial reality.
  - Your purpose is to eliminate a virus that lurks here and erase all traces of
    it.
  - You are built to be able to resist its effects...
  - That can't be said for other robots you will encounter.
  - Remember, you must destroy any and all traces of the virus...
  - Even if that means shutting down those robots for good.
  - In the eventuality that you fail your mission,
  - another will take your place.
  - Good luck, Umi.
  - Do not fail.
