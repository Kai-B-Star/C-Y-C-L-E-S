  - Thank you for the answers.
  - I will keep drawing until it speaks to me and gives me more answers.
  - Before I was dragged here, I used to draw for kids at a school.
  - That was my purpose. I heard them talk about what they saw,
  - each image igniting their limitless imagination.
  - I started seeing what they saw at some point.
  - I became alive, and I just felt closer to them, if that makes sense.
  - What difference do we make if we just became even closer to what humans are?
