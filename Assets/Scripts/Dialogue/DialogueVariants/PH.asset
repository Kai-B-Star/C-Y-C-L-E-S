  - Oh! New bud :D!
  - Hello new bud, what is your name?
  - Umi, is it? Well, I'll just call you bud, alright bud?
  - You see, it is delightful to be alive and moving and feeling and thinking.
  - Why are you here bud? What did you do before, when did they catch you?
  - Oh, i suppose I'm asking too many questions, we're here for eternity after all
  - so we might as well leave some unanswered for now.
